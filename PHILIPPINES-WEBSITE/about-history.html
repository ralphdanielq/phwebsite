			<h2 style="font-size: 35px"> WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE PHILIPPINES? </h2> 
		</div>
			<br><br>
		<p style="text-indent: 0; text-align: center"><b> I. Beginnings </b></p> <br>
			<p> The archipelago was produced by volcanic explosions around 50 million years ago. 
			The earliest settlers migrated from the Asian mainland some 30,000 years ago, possibly 
			via land bridges constructed during the glacial ages. After the year 1000 A.D. Muslim 
			traders from Borneo were then welcomed by the coastal peasants, who also welcomed Chinese 
			trade and immigration. The Philippines' original people were of Mongoloid heritage, which 
			still dominates today. The presence of the Spanish Christians halted the steady expansion 
			of Islam from Borneo into the middle and northern islands.</p>	
			<br><br>
			
		<p style="text-indent: 0; text-align: center"><b> II. The West's discovery of the Philippines and the Revolution </b></p> <br>	
			<img src="ferMagellan.jpeg" style="float: center">
			<br><br>
			<p> Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator who was traveling for Spain, claimed the 
			Philippines in 1521, naming the islands after King Philip II of Spain. Then, they were 
			known as Las Felipinas. Filipino culture had been heavily influenced by Spanish ideology 
			and culture by the 1830s, to the point where the population started considering independence 
			from Spain. Filipino agriculture was advanced by the Spanish administration to the point of 
			self-sufficiency.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src="joseRizal.jpg" style="float: center; width: 111; height: 140;">
			<br><br>
			<p>Filipino nationalists started speaking out after a few failed efforts at independence and an 
			equal number of atrocities committed by Spain. Jose Rizal was one of the most well-known people 
			of the period. He received his medical education at the Universities of Santo Tomas in the 
			Philippines and Madrid. Two significant books by Rizal depicted the wrongdoings of Spanish 
			authority. Despite being outlawed, the novels were smuggled into the Philippines and were read 
			there. On December 30, 1896, the evening before he was put to death, Rizal dubbed the Philippines 
			"the Pearl of the Oriental Seas." Every year on December 30, we remember him.</p>	
			<br><br>
			<img src="flagSmall.jpeg" style="float: center; width: 111; height: 140;">
			<br><br>
			<p>The revolution gained momentum after Rizal's execution. The Spanish were unable to put a stop 
			to the uprising, even if the Filipino rebels under Emilio Aguinaldo's leadership did not achieve 
			total independence. The Pact of Biak-na-Bato was reached in December 1897 after talks with Spain. 
			All of the rebels received amnesty, and the revolution's leaders returned to Hong Kong after going 
			into voluntary exile. Aguinaldo and his countrymen created the Philippine flag that is used today 
			when they were in Hong Kong.</p>	
			
			<br><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 0; text-align: center"><b> III. The American Era and Independence </b></p> <br>	
			<br>
			<p>Cuba, another province of Spain, was battling for independence from Spanish domination at the 
			same time the Philippines were doing the same. However, the United States supported Cuba. War between 
			the United States and Spain was about to break out when the USS Maine, an American warship, sunk in 
			the port of Havana.</p>	
			
			<br><p>Spain was at war with the United States on April 25, 1898, and the U.S. Commodore George Dewey of 
			the Asiatic Squadron was tasked with confronting the Spanish navy in the Philippines. On the morning 
			of May 1, 1898, Dewey launched an assault on the Spanish armada from the USS Olympia. The Spanish fleet 
			at Manila Bay was completely destroyed by the conflict, which lasted barely a few hours. Only minimal 
			damage was incurred by the American navy.</p>	
			
			<br><p>With the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, the Spanish-American War came to a conclusion. 
			The American administration, however, was only concerned with Cuba's independence, not the Philippines'. 
			By way of the Treaty, Spain gave the United States $20 million in exchange for the Philippines, Guam, and 
			Puerto Rico, and Cuba obtained its freedom. American opinion on the morality of owning colonial dependencies 
			was uneasy and divided given its own history of colonial revolution. The United States was unsure on what to 
			do with the Philippines after almost accidentally acquiring them. The First Philippine Commission (Schurman 
			Commission) was established by President McKinley on January 20, 1899, to offer recommendations.</p>
			
			<br><p>Ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 8, 1941, the Japanese troops invaded the Philippines. 
			On December 12, 1941, American troops commanded by General Douglas MacArthur retreated to Java. "I shall return," 
			MacArthur said. In October 1944, General MacArthur maintained his word and descended on the island of Leyte with 
			a sizable landing force. With the aid of Filipino rebels, American soldiers decimated the Japanese army over the 
			course of the following four months.</p>	
			
			<br><p>The pre-war Commonwealth administration was reinstated by the United States after the war. The Philippines had
			become an independent republic by 1946 after leaving the Commonwealth.</p>
